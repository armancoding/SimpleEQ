The plugin utilizes JUCE framework, if you are trying to clone the project, clone it into a foulder of a new JUCE framework plugin. Once the project is done, a standalone and VST3 pluging executables will be available for download too. 

The code included is a free for all, no licensing required on my end, that being said juce framework licencing will apply to any products created with their framework. Have fun with the code
